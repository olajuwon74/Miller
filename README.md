# MIXER

Mixer is an onchain music platform that gives musicians the appropirate platform to showcase themselves to the world and also earn while doing what they love
we hope to help people get the exposure they desire at no cost at all. For everytime their content is streamed they would receive a token and there is no limit to the amount they can receive, listeners can also tip them.

## How it works
Anybody is allowed to indicate their interest and singers are chosen at random using chainlink to generate random numbers within the range of the indicated numbers of address, the selected numbers are then mapped to get the corresponding addresses, mixer is free and fair and there is no central authority.
